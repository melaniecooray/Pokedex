Pokedex:

This app is designed to allow a user to see all the different types of Pokemon and filter/search for them based on different attributes, such as attack, defense, and health. The search screen allows a user to specify these categories, or search for an individual pokemon by name or number. If chosen by category, a display of all of the matching pokemon will appear, in grid and list view. If searched directly, a profile of that pokemon will appear. The user also has the option to keep a running list of favorite pokemon.
